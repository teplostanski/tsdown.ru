# Plugins

`tsdown` uses [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs) as its core engine, which means it seamlessly supports Rolldown plugins. Plugins are a powerful way to extend and customize the bundling process, enabling features like code transformation, asset handling, and more.

## Supported Plugin Ecosystems

### Rolldown Plugins

Since `tsdown` is built on Rolldown, it supports all Rolldown plugins. You can use any plugin designed for Rolldown to enhance your build process.

### Unplugin

[Unplugin](https://unplugin.unjs.io/) is a modern plugin framework that supports multiple bundlers, including Rolldown. Most Unplugin plugins (commonly named with the `unplugin-` prefix) work seamlessly with `tsdown`.

### Rollup Plugins

Rolldown is highly compatible with Rollup's plugin API, so `tsdown` can use most Rollup plugins without modification. This gives you access to a wide range of existing plugins in the Rollup ecosystem.

### Vite Plugins

Vite plugins may work with `tsdown` if they do not rely on Vite-specific internal APIs or behaviors. However, plugins that depend heavily on Vite's internals may not be compatible. We plan to improve support for Vite plugins in the future.

## How to Use Plugins

To use plugins in `tsdown`, you need to add them to the `plugins` array in your configuration file. Plugins **cannot** be added via the CLI.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use a plugin:

```ts [tsdown.config.ts]
import SomePlugin from 'some-plugin'
import { defineConfig } from 'tsdown'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [SomePlugin()],
})
```

For specific plugin usage, refer to the plugin's own documentation.

## Writing Your Own Plugins

If you want to create a custom plugin for `tsdown`, you can follow Rolldown's plugin development guide. Rolldown's plugin API is highly flexible and similar to Rollup's, making it easy to get started.

Refer to the [Rolldown Plugin Development Guide](https://rolldown.rs/guide/plugin-development) for detailed instructions on writing your own plugins.

> [!TIP]
> Plugins are a great way to extend `tsdown`'s functionality. Whether you're using existing plugins or creating your own, they allow you to tailor the bundling process to your project's specific needs.
